/*
 * Definition
 *
 * The ruling authority is an individual head of state represented on numismatic or exonumia items (for example, Charlemagne). Heads of state are understood in a broad sense, including monarchs, regents, governors, lords, ranking nobles or clergy, leaders, officers, usurpers, etc.
 *
 * When heads of state are not individually represented on numismatic or exonumia items, the ruling authority can be the form of government (for example, free imperial city), a specific government or governing body (for example, second republic), a distinct historic period (for example, German occupation, sede vacante), or the official name of the issuer, when the name changed throughout history (for example, Kingdom of Swaziland, Kingdom of Eswatini).
 *
 * Ruling authorities are included in the Numista database only if they issued coins, banknotes or exonumia items. Multiple issuers can share the same ruling authorities.
 * How to request the addition of a new ruling authority?
 *
 * Please post a request on the forum indicating:
 * the name of the ruling authority in English and in the local language (and if possible also in French and Spanish)
 * the name of issuing authorities (as they appear on Numista) in which they ruled, with titles and date ranges for each of them
 * if the ruling authority had different successive titles, we need to create one version for each date range
 * its Wikidata code (for example, Q40787 for tsar Nicholas II)
 * if applicable, the dynasty, house, or more generally the group to which the ruler belongs (for example, House of Romanov for tsar Nicholas II)
 * if there are no entries yet on Numista, the link to an auction site or a reference catalogue presenting at least one coin or banknote from this ruler
 * if they already exist, the link of one or more Numista records that you want to classify under this ruling authority
 *
 * It is not required to provide all the information above. However, complete requests can be verified and added to the database quicker by the catalogue admins.
 * Rules for ruling authority naming
 *
 * Regnal numbers follow the name in Roman numerals with no ordinal indicators.
 * Henry I
 * Henry Ier, Henry I., Henry 1st
 * Cognomens (nicknames) should not be used, except if thy are very common is included.

 * Sobriquets are used only when they are universally better known than the name of the ruler:

 * When ruling authority is a form of government:
