# Improvement Tasks for Colligendis Server

This document contains a prioritized list of actionable improvement tasks for the Colligendis Server project. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase's quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

## Architecture and Design

1. [ ] Refactor the application to follow a cleaner layered architecture (controller -> service -> repository)
2. [ ] Implement proper dependency injection throughout the application instead of using static utilities
3. [ ] Create a comprehensive error handling strategy with custom exceptions and global exception handlers
4. [ ] Standardize API response formats across all endpoints
5. [ ] Implement proper logging throughout the application using a logging framework like SLF4J
6. [ ] Extract configuration properties into a centralized configuration class with proper validation

## Security Improvements

7. [ ] Fix the JwtTokenProvider's getAuthentication method to properly return user details
8. [ ] Secure the JWT secret key by moving it to environment variables or a secure vault
9. [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection for non-GET endpoints
10. [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on authentication endpoints
11. [ ] Implement proper input validation for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
12. [ ] Add security headers to HTTP responses (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
13. [ ] Implement proper password validation rules during user registration
14. [ ] Add account lockout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts

## Code Quality and Maintainability

15. [ ] Remove commented-out code throughout the codebase
16. [ ] Fix inconsistencies in the User entity (commented setters vs @Data annotation)
17. [ ] Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to all public classes and methods
18. [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all services
19. [ ] Fix the getAuthorities method in User entity to return an empty list instead of null
20. [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
21. [ ] Refactor long methods into smaller, more focused methods
22. [ ] Remove hardcoded values and move them to configuration properties

## Performance Optimization

23. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
24. [ ] Optimize Neo4j queries to reduce database load
25. [ ] Add pagination to endpoints that return large collections
26. [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
27. [ ] Optimize JWT token validation to reduce overhead
28. [ ] Add database connection pooling configuration

## Testing

29. [ ] Implement unit tests for all service classes
30. [ ] Add integration tests for REST controllers
31. [ ] Implement security tests to verify authentication and authorization
32. [ ] Add performance tests for critical endpoints
33. [ ] Implement continuous integration with automated testing

## Documentation

34. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
35. [ ] Add a README.md file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
36. [ ] Document the database schema and relationships
37. [ ] Create developer onboarding documentation
38. [ ] Add code style guidelines and contribution guidelines

## DevOps and Infrastructure

39. [ ] Containerize the application using Docker
40. [ ] Create deployment scripts for different environments (dev, staging, production)
41. [ ] Implement proper application health checks and monitoring
42. [ ] Set up automated backups for the Neo4j database
43. [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Feature Enhancements

44. [ ] Implement user profile management functionality
45. [ ] Add support for password reset functionality
46. [ ] Implement email verification for new user registrations
47. [ ] Add support for OAuth2 authentication with popular providers
48. [ ] Implement a more robust role-based access control system
49. [ ] Add support for user preferences and settings
50. [ ] Implement data export functionality for users
